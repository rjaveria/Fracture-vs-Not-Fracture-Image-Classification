Medical imaging to analyze and detect different diseases and problems now a day an emerging field.
In this project we will design automated techniques and methods to analyze and detect bone fracture
from X-ray images. X-ray images when examined manually it is time consuming and prone to errors.
So our proposed system is able to detect fracture more accurately. images are a crucial resource for
assessing the severity and prediction of bone injuries caused by trauma or accident. Fracture
detection in long bones is a very challenging task due to the limited resolution of the original X-Ray
images, as well as the complexity of bone structures and their possible fractures. So our proposed
automated bone fracture detection system will work on these aspects.
Functional Requirements:
The system should have the following features:
• Image Datasets are maintained.
• Image is selected for examine.
• Image is shown as real image and then focused or noise removed image
• Noise is removed from the image and image is transformed to clearer image so that system
• Image is shown as real image and then focused or noise removed image
• Noise is removed from the image and image is transformed to clearer image so that system
can easily detect fracture
• Clearer image is used to detect fracture
• System detects fracture based on the type of fracture.
